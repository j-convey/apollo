### Key Technologies

- **Flutter**: Cross-platform UI framework
- **media_kit**: High-performance audio playback library
- **sqflite**: SQLite database for local caching
- **http**: REST API communication
- **shared_preferences**: Local key-value storage
- **window_manager**: Custom window controls
- **url_launcher**: External URL handling for authentication

### Data Flow

1. **Authentication**: User authenticates with Plex via PIN-based OAuth flow
2. **Server Discovery**: App discovers available Plex Media Servers
3. **Library Sync**: Music library metadata is cached locally in SQLite
4. **Playback**: Audio streams are played using media_kit with Plex transcoding
5. **Caching**: Frequently accessed data is stored locally for performance

## 🔧 Configuration

### Plex Media Server Setup

1. Ensure your Plex Media Server has music libraries configured
2. Enable remote access if connecting from outside your local network
3. Verify that your Plex account has access to the music libraries

### App Configuration

The app automatically handles most configuration, but you can customize:

- **Server Connections**: Choose between local and remote server URLs
- **Audio Quality**: Adjust playback quality settings (future feature)
- **Cache Size**: Configure local storage limits (future feature)

## 📱 Usage

4. **Server Selection**: Choose your Plex Media Server from the available options
5. **Library Sync**: The app will automatically sync your music library

### Daily Usage

1. **Browse Music**: Use the home screen to access your library
2. **Search**: Use the search bar in the app bar to find specific tracks
3. **Play Music**: Click on any track to start playback
4. **Queue Management**: Add tracks to queue and control playback order
5. **Navigation**: Use back/forward buttons for navigation history

## 🔒 Security

- **Secure Authentication**: Uses Plex's official OAuth flow with PIN-based authentication
- **Token Management**: Securely stores authentication tokens using platform-specific secure storage
- **HTTPS Communication**: All network requests use HTTPS encryption
- **Local Data**: Sensitive data is stored securely on the local device
